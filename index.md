## Favorite lab from 120L Labs

* Lab 10 part 2

    This is one of my favorite labs because it introduced me to vectors being really interesting and very straightforward. It is simple to understand and to easily complete  by calculating the popularity and density for states. In this lab, my partner and I were able to bond and work together really proficiently and fully experience the lab without asking for any assistant. 

* Lab 2 part 1

    This was also one of my favorite labs because of the many concepts of string to create variables to initialize to their respective command for the user to enter by using std::cout input and std::cin for the output. This is very profound and exciting as I long for it during lecture and class reading but was never able to believe to have the ability to accomplish it during the lab. 

* Lab 1

    My first ever moment of coding was lab 1, coming from a background with no knowledge in coding and computer science was very difficult to keep up with the class. But in this lab the instructions and labels were very specific and easy to understand with a little bit of thinking. In this lab, it introduced me to coding and linux and was able to attract me to learn a whole new language in coding.
